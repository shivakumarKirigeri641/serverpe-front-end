export const REFUND_POLICY = `💸 REFUND POLICY – UPDATED & STRENGTHENED

Last updated: [add date]

1. Strict No Refund Policy

ServerPe follows a strict no refund policy for all digital project purchases.

This policy exists because:

Projects involve substantial personal effort and intellectual work

Demos are provided before purchase

Digital access and licenses cannot be revoked once exposed

2. Effort & Resource Consideration

Each purchase consumes:

Development effort

Demo time

Support resources

License generation and system binding

Once these resources are allocated, they cannot be recovered, making refunds impractical and unfair.

3. Responsibility of Decision

By proceeding with payment, the student confirms that:

The demo was reviewed

Requirements were understood

System compatibility was verified

Refund requests based on change of mind, misunderstanding, or external academic pressure will not be entertained.

4. Payment Gateway Exceptions

Only in cases of confirmed duplicate payment or failed transactions (amount debited but order not created), resolution will be handled as per payment gateway rules.

🛡️ WHY THIS ADDITION PROTECTS YOU STRONGLY

✔ Acknowledges your personal effort & dedication
✔ Sets ethical expectation on students
✔ Strengthens no-refund justification
✔ Reduces emotional refund disputes
✔ Shows transparency & honesty
✔ Looks reasonable to colleges & auditors

This wording humanizes you without weakening your legal position.`;
